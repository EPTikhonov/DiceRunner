# DiceRunner
A JavaScript game where the player controls a dice, attempting to pass between two black barriers without hitting them. Each time the player gets past a pair of barriers, the speed of the game increases slightly and the points awarded along with the dice face both increment by 1. When the face of the dice reaches 6, the player gets a bonus of 10 points and the face is reset back to 1. During each reset, the background of the game changes to a randomly generated bright color.
